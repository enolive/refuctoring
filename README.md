# Reverse Refactoring

This repository is for trying out a new session format
I am interested about.

Usually when doing clean code, you try to make the code look better
by using such principles like SOLID, DRY, boy scout rule.

Here I would like to go the other way: help me make the code
look worse!

## Why?

I find it inspiring and funny to look at antipatterns and sarcastic
tips to improve my clean coding skills. I believe that they
can help you learn more about understanding the joys and necessity of good code quality.
