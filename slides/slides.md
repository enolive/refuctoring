# What's refuctoring?

> Refuctoring is the process of taking a well-
designed piece of code and, through a
series of small, reversible changes,
making it completely unmaintainable by
anybody <span v-mark.orange>except yourself</span>.

# How?

<v-clicks>

- Me as the driver

- Make code more messy
- Tests must still pass
- Stay under the radar by keeping the original API
